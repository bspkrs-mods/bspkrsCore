#### Setup Java
The Java JDK is used to compile bspkrsCore.

1. Download and install the Java JDK.
    * [Windows/Mac download link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html). Scroll down, accept the `Oracle Binary Code License Agreement for Java SE`, and download it (if you have a 64-bit OS, please download the 64-bit version).
    * Linux: Installation methods for certain popular flavors of Linux are listed below. If your distribution is not listed, follow the instructions specific to your package manager or install it manually [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html).
        * Gentoo: `emerge dev-java/oracle-jdk-bin`
        * Archlinux: `pacman -S jdk7-openjdk`
        * Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk`
        * Fedora: `yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk`
2. Set up the environment.
    * Windows: Set environment variables for the JDK.
        1. Go to `Control Panel\System and Security\System`, and click on `Advanced System Settings` on the left-hand side.
        2. Click on `Environment Variables`.
        3. Under `System Variables`, click `New`.
        4. For `Variable Name`, input `JAVA_HOME`.
        5. For `Variable Value`, input something similar to `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_45` exactly as shown (or wherever your Java JDK installation is), and click `Ok`.
        6. Scroll down to a variable named `Path`, and double-click on it.
        7. Append `;%JAVA_HOME%\bin` EXACTLY AS SHOWN and click `Ok`. Make sure the location is correct; double-check just to make sure.
3. Open up your command line and run `javac`. If it spews out a bunch of possible options and the usage, then you're good to go. If not try the steps again.

#### Setup Gradle
Gradle is used to execute the various build tasks when compiling bspkrsCore.

1. Download and install Gradle.
    * [Windows/Mac download link](http://www.gradle.org/downloads). You only need the binaries, but choose whatever flavor you want.
        * Unzip the package and put it wherever you want, eg `C:\Gradle`.
    * Linux: Installation methods for certain popular flavors of Linux are listed below. If your distribution is not listed, follow the instructions specific to your package manager or install it manually [here](http://www.gradle.org/downloads).
        * Gentoo: `emerge dev-java/gradle-bin`
        * Archlinux: You'll have to install it from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gradle).
        * Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install gradle`
        * Fedora: Install Gradle manually from its website (see above), as Fedora ships a "broken" version of Gradle. Use `yum install gradle` only if you know what you're doing.
2. Set up the environment.
    * Windows: Set environment variables for Gradle.
        1. Go back to `Environment Variables` and then create a new system variable.
        2. For `Variable Name`, input `GRADLE_HOME`.
        3. For `Variable Value`, input something similar to `C:\Gradle-1.10` exactly as shown (or wherever your Gradle installation is), and click `Ok`.
        4. Scroll down to `Path` again, and append `;%GRADLE_HOME%\bin` EXACTLY AS SHOWN and click `Ok`. Once again, double-check the location.
3. Open up your command line and run `gradle`. If it says "Welcome to Gradle [version].", then you're good to go. If not try the steps again.

#### Setup Git
Git is used to clone bspkrsCore and update your local copy.

1. Download and install Git [here](http://git-scm.com/download/).
2. *Optional* Download and install a Git GUI client, such as Github for Windows/Mac, SmartGitHg, TortoiseGit, etc. A nice list is available [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).

#### Setup bspkrsCore
This section assumes that you're using the command-line version of Git.

1. Open up your command line.
2. Navigate to a place where you want to download bspkrsCore's source (eg `C:\Development\Github\Minecraft\`) by executing `cd [folder location]`. This location is known as `mcdev` from now on.
3. Execute `git clone git@github.com:bspkrs/bspkrsCore.git`. This will download bspkrsCore's source into `mcdev`.
4. Right now, you should have a directory that looks something like:

***
    mcdev
    \-bspkrsCore
        \-bspkrsCore's files (should have build.gradle)
***

#### Compile bspkrsCore
1. Execute `gradle setupDecompWorkspace`. This sets up Forge and downloads the necessary libraries to build bspkrsCore. This might take some time, be patient.
    * You will generally only have to do this once until the Forge version in `build.properties` changes.
2. Execute `gradle build`. If you did everything right, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` will be displayed after it finishes. This should be relatively quick.
    * If you see `BUILD FAILED`, check the error output (it should be right around `BUILD FAILED`), fix everything (if possible), and try again.
3. Go to `mcdev\bspkrsCore\build\libs`.
    * You should see a `.jar` file named `[#.#.#]bspkrsCore-<version>.jar`.
4. Copy the jar into your Minecraft mods folder, and you are done!

#### Updating Your Repository
In order to get the most up-to-date builds, you'll have to periodically update your local repository.

1. Open up your command line.
2. Navigate to `mcdev` in the console.
3. Make sure you have not made any changes to the local repository, or else there might be issues with Git.
    * If you have, try reverting them to the status that they were when you last updated your repository.
4. Execute `git pull master`. This pulls all commits from the official repository that do not yet exist on your local repository and updates it.
